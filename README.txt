The data is based on real anonymized Czech bank transactions and account info.

Objective:
- Examine/clean the individual dataset
- Combine them into a single dataset, which is subject to more cleaning
- Create new columns based on existing columns
- Prepare the new dataset for further analysis

We'll work on three datasets in three separate csv files:

  - account: each record describes static characteristics of an account
  - transaction: each record describes one transaction on an account
  - district: each record describes demographic characteristics of a district
